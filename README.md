GraphRAG Offline Knowledge Portal (Demo)

This project implements a fully offline GraphRAG pipeline that can read PDF documents, extract knowledge, build a knowledge graph, and perform hybrid retrieval (graph + vector search) to find the most relevant information for any user question — without using any cloud APIs.

This version does NOT require an LLM.
It only retrieves relevant evidence chunks.
(LLM answer generation can be added later.)
